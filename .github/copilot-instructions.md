# ML/DL Development Workspace Instructions

This workspace is configured for Machine Learning and Deep Learning development using Python.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development
- `src/` - Python source code modules
- `data/` - Dataset storage (use .gitignore for large files)
- `models/` - Trained model storage
- `experiments/` - Experimental code and scripts
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Development Guidelines
- Use virtual environments for package management
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Use Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and prototyping
- Implement production code in Python modules in the `src/` directory
- Use type hints where appropriate for better code documentation
- Keep data preprocessing and model training separate
- Version control models using appropriate tools

## Common Tasks
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model deployment preparation

## Libraries and Frameworks
- NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for classical ML
- TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch for deep learning
- Jupyter for interactive development
